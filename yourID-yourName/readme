The extracted homework has the following structure:

yourID-yourName
├── ex2
│   ├── grid_world.py
│   └──  __init__.py
│
├── ex4
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── mdp.py
│   └── misc.py
│
├── ex2.ipynb
├── ex4.ipynb
├── hw4.pdf
└── readme.txt

Folder ex2 and ex4 contain the python scripts for Task 2 (Search) and 4 (Optimal Policy) respectively. And ex2.ipynb and ex4.ipynb are the coding notebook where you should type in your answers for Task 2 and 4 respectively.
When you submit your homework, you should rename the folder, and add a hw4_sol.pdf file for pen and paper solutions of Task 1 (Language Models) and Task3 (TamagotchAI) respectively. Your renamed folder should look like this (example):

usausa-Donald-Trump
├── ex2
│   ├── grid_world.py
│   └──  __init__.py
│
├── ex4
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── mdp.py
│   └── misc.py
│
├── ex2.ipynb
├── ex4.ipynb
├── hw4.pdf
├── hw4_sol.pdf
└── readme.txt

Afterwards, compress the parent folder (the one with your name and id) to a zip file and upload it to ILIAS.
